Tips for good infrasturecture creation
1. Create a tree to consider all the essesntials 
2. Try to give the hard code for the moduel if possible
3. Firstl create one instance from the modudle then make other
4. Try to use the output block and do commnet 
5. Continue to write the mistakes you do as I am doing following

Here I am going to write the mistakes I did
1. I declared a variable 2 times
2. I did not write var before the variable
3. I have to privide the id of  an resource but I did typo like "aws_security_group.tg-subnet" here I forgotten .id
4. For the ingress rule of ICMP, I did not provided the proper ports => -1 , last time it was 22, that's why it was showing duplicate
5. I had created a module resoruce (security goup). I have to give the sg id in module aspect (aws_security_group.tg_sg.id) but I was giving in root level aspect (sg_id).
6. I did not gave ip protocol = icmp, I had written tcp (for tcp, I can give the range)

In this project i learnt how i can create a strucutre 
in next project I will create a public environment, dynamic ami
in next project I will create a an hybrid environment
in next project i will create a transit gateway
