here in this project, we had implemented the following concepts
  - Modules
  - EC2
  - Key pair
  - Security Group

When we talk about module we did the following
  - Created moudle and made multiple instances of module
  - Created local variables in module and provided Arguments to module variables
  - Output the the values from modules

We had worked about backend
  - We had created an S3 backend, for which we had installed aws cli at terminal
  - We had manually created a bucket, bucket from terraform was not being created.

Further we will work on migration and locing mechanisme, prefer project2. I am leaving this project as it is.

Things to learn in terraform
  - creating vpc using terraform
  - creating s3 bucket using terraform
  - Sourcing the dynamic ami id
